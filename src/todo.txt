TODO:
Set font color.
Buttons and inputs should "save" their state. for example: "Bold" -> "Unbold".
Always hide controls when in edit.
Show all "pages" on same table (do not use paginator, make table grow)
	Paginator: * set number of row per page
			   * disable Back/Next button if reach start/end
					# (some better feedback to tell reach end of list, or start of list if going backwards)
Filter when click on attribut.
A reset all style button
					
REFACTOR-TODO:
	Work directly with the meta data of Qlik-object instead of this middle variable that requires load/save
	A big refactor since no everything is in same "class" and stuff getting more complex?

RE-THINK:
	If new search. Reset style settings?
	Refresh style of every element when anykind of repaint/interact even if it is not needed? It is more safe
