TODO:
Set font color.
Buttons and inputs should "save" their state. for example: "Bold" -> "Unbold".
Always hide controls when in edit.
Show all "pages" on same table (do not use paginator, make table grow)
	Paginator: * set number of row per page
			   * disable Back/Next button if reach start/end
					# (some better feedback to tell reach end of list, or start of list if going backwards)
Filter when click on attribut.
A reset all style button
					
REFACTOR-TODO:
	Work directly with the meta data of Qlik-object instead of this middle variable that requires load/save
	A big refactor since no everything is in same "class" and stuff getting more complex?

RE-THINK:
	If new search. Reset style settings?
	Refresh style of every element when anykind of repaint/interact even if it is not needed? It is more safe
    
BUGS?
    Seen cases where I only show one row per page in scrollmode that rows have been not appeared. Look into why? Even if we one row per page is never used this can be good to look into anyway. If "One row per page" can be used, make option not valid.
    
    Look into why press two times before first apply style setting
    
    Reverse order when click twice on header column (ask qlik slack?)
    
    Export image (wait for answer from qlik community)
    
    Fix the grey line colors between styled background colors. (remove grey line?)
